# Iris Flower Classification

In this repository, I have completed an assignment on Iris Flower Classification using machine learning techniques. 
Here's a brief overview of the work:

## Assignment Details
- **Objective:** To classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on their sepal and petal characteristics.
- **Approach:**
  - Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure and relationships between variables.
  - Utilized various data visualization libraries to create insightful graphs and plots.
  - Preprocessed the data by splitting it into features (x) and target labels (y) and applied standard scaling for normalization.
  - Built a classification model using Logistic Regression and evaluated its performance.
  - Achieved a remarkable accuracy score of 100% on the test dataset.

## Repository Structure
- **data:** Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **images:** Includes visualizations generated during EDA and model evaluation.
- **notebook:** Houses the Jupyter Notebook file containing the complete code implementation and analysis.

## Key Highlights
- Thorough exploration of the Iris flower dataset, uncovering insights and patterns.
- Extensive use of advanced visualization techniques to enhance data understanding.
- Methodical preprocessing steps to prepare the data for model training.
- Implementation of Logistic Regression model with exceptional accuracy.
- Detailed analysis and documentation provided in the Jupyter Notebook.

Feel free to explore the repository and review the notebook for a comprehensive understanding of the Iris Flower Classification task. 

Happy learning !!
